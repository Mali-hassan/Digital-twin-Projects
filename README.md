# üß† Digital Twin Projects

A collection of *Digital Twin and Robotics* projects exploring autonomous control, swarm coordination, and reinforcement learning implemented using **ROS2, Unity, and Python**

---

## üöÄ Projects Included

### 1. üê¢ Autonomous TurtleBot
A simulation of an autonomous TurtleBot integrated with Unity and ROS2, capable of environment scanning, obstacle avoidance, and human detection using sensors and control algorithms.

- *Tech:* ROS2 | Unity | Python | C++
- *Features:* Path planning, obstacle avoidance, laser targeting
- *Goal:* Create a real-time digital twin for autonomous navigation

---

### 2. ü§ñ Swarm Robots (Consensus Algorithm)
Multiple robots coordinate their positions and velocities using *distributed consensus control*.

- *Tech:* ROS2 | Gazebo | Python | Control Systems
- *Features:* Decentralized control, leader-follower model, state synchronization
- *Goal:* Test and visualize swarm coordination and stability

---

### 3. üß© Swarm Robots with Reinforcement Learning
An AI-based approach for swarm coordination using *multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)*.

- *Tech:* ROS2 | Python | PyTorch | RLlib
- *Features:* Learning-based coordination, reward shaping, adaptive strategies
- *Goal:* Compare classical consensus vs RL-based swarm control
